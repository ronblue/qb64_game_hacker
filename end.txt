THE END SO FAR - PRESENT DAY...

YOU LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN HIDING... NOT KNOWING
IF YOU TRUELY MADE IT... AND FOR WHAT IT WAS FOR...
OR WAS IT WORTH IT IN THE END... FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
YOU LOOK EACH NIGHT AT THE STARS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS...
AND YOU REMEMBER AND WONDER ABOUT SOPHIE AND DID SHE EVER
FIND PEACE WHEREEVER SHE IS NOW... YOU THINK ON THE CRAZY
DAYS YOU WERE A HACKER AND NOW YOU ARE JUST NOBODY... YOU TEACH
SCHOOL BOYS PRIVATE LASSONS IN PROGRAMMING TO GET BY...
YOU KEEP A LOW PROFILE TO STAY ALIVE... IN A SENSE YOU MADE IT
BUT IN OTHER TERMES YOU FAILED...
YOU LAUGH SADDLY AND THINK FOR YOURSELF...
WHAT WAS IT GOOD FOR?... YOU MISS SOMETIMES THE EXCITMENT OF HACKING
BUT YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS ARE GONE FOREVER...
YOU KEEP LOOKING BEHIND YOUR BACK WORRIED YOUR COVER MIGHT
BE EXPOSED AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF TERMINATED...
FOR NOW YOU MADE IT AND FOOLED EVERYONE...
BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU FOOLED YOURSELF AS WELL.
YOU LOOK AT THE STARS HOW THEY SHINE...

                     THE END...
