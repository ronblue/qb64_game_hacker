THE END - GAME OVER...

YOUR HANDS AND LEGS ARE TIED WITH CHAINES AS THE MAFIA THUGZ
DRIVE YOU YOUR LAST TRIP TO THE SITE WHERE YOU WILL BE TERMINATED
AND YOUR BODY WILL BE DISPOSE OF...

LIKE A FOOL YOU TOOK YOUR TIME TOO MUCH... AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE...
AND YOU REGRET YOU COULD NOT HELP POOR SOPHIE... THE BOSS TOLD YOU
WITH AN UGLY SMILE SHE KILLED HERSELF SO YOUR CONTRACT AND YOURSELF ARE
TERMINATED LIKE YOU KNEW IT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST DAY...

THEY TOOK YOUR COMPUTER AND GOT THE DATA THEY WANTED - 
AND YOU AND SOPHIE OR ANYONE ELSE WHERE JUST EXPENDABLES...


					THE END
