THE END SO FAR - PRESENT DAY...

WELL YOU CAME CLEAN... DID THE RIGHT THING... SWITCHED SIDES...
YOU CONTACTED THE AUTHORITIES AND REPORTED A CRIME...
YOU COOPARETED WITH THE FBI AND TESTEFIED AGAINST YOUR MAFIA BOSSES
AND THEY WERE SENT TO A LONG TIME IN PRISON...
YOU NOW LIVE YOUR SECONED LIFE UNDER THE "WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM"
AND YOU WORK AS A WEB DEVELOPER FOR A SMALL COMPANY...
NON OF YOUR NEIGHBOURS OR CO-WORKERS KNOW A THING ABOUT YOUR PAST...
YOU TAKE COMFORT KNOWING THAT SOPHIE ALSO GOT THE HELP SHE NEEDED...
AND YOU HOPE SHE WILL STAY OKAY AND FREE... YOU WISH HER ONLY THE BEST...
AND AS FOR YOU? YOU ARE STILL LOOKING FOR WHATEVER YOU FEEL IS MISSING
FROM YOUR LIFE... NOT MONEY NOT PLESURE BUT HAPPINESS ONLY LOVE CAN BRING...

FOR NOW YOU CAN BE PROUD OF YOURSELF CAUSE YOUR SELF-CONSCIOUS IS INTACT...
YOU CHOOSE WISELY AND COURAGEIOUSLY TO DO THE GOOD THING...
NO MATTER WHAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH YOURSELF...


				THE END.
